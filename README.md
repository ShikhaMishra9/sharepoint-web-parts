# sharepoint-web-parts

_POC for custom web parts in Sharepoint_

This repository is about exploring how to solve an issue for a client that needs to visualise ongoing activities in Sharepoint. These activities will be divided into three categories:

1. Upcoming
1. Ongoing
1. Completed

We have identified four possible solutions: 

1. Create a React app, host it in Radix, and embed it using an iframe
1. Create a PowerBI report and embed it as a PowerBI web part
1. Create a Power App and embed it as a Power App web part
1. Create a web part in React and deploy it to the app catalog

Weâ€™ll with an MVP using a Sharepoint List as a data source, then look into either Power BI or a Power App.
